# About

Every organization has a huge pool of unrecognized talent and skills. It is less likely one would be able to know and recognize people with different sets of skills and talents. One of the significant problems that Adostrings solves is helping organizations and people within the organization find the talent they are looking for within the organization before searching for them outside the organization. 

Adostrings is a private network for organizations that only allows allowed emails specified by the organization to register, preventing people outside the organization from accessing internal information. Besides that Adostrings also allows people within the orginization to know and meet more people, post stories, events and make requests.

Adostrings is a project that we are submitting as our final semester project, we wish to give our college its own private network were students and faculties can interact and get to know more people
